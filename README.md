# Forces
This is a forces simulator, written in C# using Unity as part of the OCR A Level GCE Computing H446

## Plan
Create program that can simulate forces and other aspects of mechanics in various different situations:
* Solar System
  * Interactions between different numbers of bodies (starting from 2)
  * Can then use this for EM interactions, as they follow similar principals
* Forces and Moments
  * F=ma to gain acceleration of particles
  * Collisions
  * Gravity
  * Moments from a point to gain tension force in wire
* Questions
  * Program can create problems with simple-ish solutions
  * Program can display problems in a way suitable for a class
  * Program gives a way to input answers
